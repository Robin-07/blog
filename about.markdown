Hi, I'm Robin.

I'm a Software Developer with around 4 years of experience in designing and building **scalable backend APIs**, **efficient SQL databases**, **seamless UIs** and more recently, **real-time communication systems** where *uptime, availability and performance* are extremely critical.

I lead the tech team at [FreJun](https://frejun.com), one of the fastest growing cloud communications firms in India (currently doing **500k+ business   calls/day**).
My day-to-day responsibilities include product discussions, system design, development, documentation and team management.

Being an obsessive learner and problem-solver, I believe my skills are not tied to any specific set of technologies and that *using the right tool for the job* is the way to go.

I'm always on the lookout for exciting problems to work on. Please feel free to get in touch with me at *robinrythm123@gmail.com*.
