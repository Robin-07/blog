#### Hi :wave:,

I'm a Software Developer with 4 years of experience architecting **scalable backend systems**, optimizing **high-throughput SQL databases**, building **seamless user interfaces** and more recently, engineering **real-time communication platforms** where *uptime*, *availability* and *performance* are mission-critical.

As a founding engineer and tech lead at [FreJun](https://frejun.com){:target="_blank"}, I helped architect and scale the platform from the ground up, growing it to process 500K+ calls daily with global reach and high availability. I'm currently building [Teler](https://frejun.ai){:target="_blank"}.

Being an obsessive learner and problem-solver, I believe my skills are not tied to any specific set of technologies and that *using the right tool for the job* is the way to go.

I'm always on the lookout for exciting problems to work on. Please feel free to get in touch with me at [hello@robinsharma.me](mailto:hello@robinsharma.me)

## Projects

### [Teler](https://frejun.ai){:target="_blank"}
Global Voice Infrastructure for AI Agents and LLMs.

Built on a distributed microservice architecture, Teler delivers advanced capabilities including **bidirectional media streaming**, **SIP trunking**, and **real-time STT/TTS**. Apart from building Teler's core VoIP infrastructure, I also wrote the [Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/teler/){:target="_blank"}, and parts of the [Docusaurus-based documentation](https://frejun.ai/docs/){:target="_blank"}.

### [Kinto (Open-source)](https://github.com/Kinto/kinto){:target="_blank"}
A generic JSON document store with sharing and synchronisation capabilities.

My contributions include implementing metrics for [cache](https://github.com/Kinto/kinto/pull/3566){:target="_blank"} and [failed authentications](https://github.com/Kinto/kinto/pull/3577){:target="_blank"}.

### [Conduit](https://rhythmiqcx.com/){:target="_blank"}
Real-time messaging backend powering [RhythmiqCX](https://rhythmiqcx.com/){:target="_blank"}.

I've written more about Conduit in this [blog post](/blog/conduit){:target="_blank"}.

### [Local Voice](https://github.com/Robin-07/local-voice){:target="_blank"}
Locally running AI voice assistant for low-latency conversations, powered by **OpenAI Whisper**, **Ollama**, and **Piper TTS**.

Delivers **< 1s round-trip latency** on consumer hardware owing to a hybrid design combining multiprocessing and asyncio.

### [VoIP Dialer](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/frejun-chrome-dialler-plu/eninbjdhgaccikhclpomppfcclammnoc?hl=en){:target="_blank"}
Chrome extension which allows users to make/receive calls directly from the browser.

Currently serves **4000+ daily active users**. Powered by **WebRTC** and **SIP.js**.
